<!-- Begin article excerpt -->
It is a provocation, I know, to open a response to Lawrence Venuti’s <em>Contra Instrumentalism – A Translation
    Polemic</em> with a metaphor for translation, given the book’s substantive discussion of translation proverbs and
their dangers. Why risk “belletrism” from the outset? But bear with me. Translator Maureen Freely’s comparison of the
translator and the jazz musician, her metaphorical mapping of one domain (jazz) onto another (translation), allows us to
see one thing in terms of something else, a situation that successful metaphors always facilitate, and hence to see
differently. And who wouldn’t want to be mentioned in the same breath as John Coltrane, and have their work compared to
his spiritual saxophonic soarings – and don’t we translators also lock ourselves in the room above the garage for weeks
on end, to then emerge with our masterpiece, as Coltrane did with <em>A Love Supreme</em>? And isn’t, or shouldn’t,
translation be something like Patricia Barber’s composition "Yellow Car” (surely itself a nod to “Blue Train”): a
musical meditation on a melody (which is not an invariant, more of a stimulus or an impulse) resulting in a series of
pieces that all appear under the same name, with one of the series a winkingly-entitled “Yet Another in a Long Series of
Yellow Car” (for which, see Barber’s early album <em>A Distortion of Love</em>)?
